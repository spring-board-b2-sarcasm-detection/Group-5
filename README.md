## Sarcasm Detection in Tweets

This project delves into the world of tweet sarcasm, where the true meaning lies beneath the surface. We're building a system that can crack the code and automatically identify sarcastic tweets. 

Sarcasm detection is a tricky business, even for humans. It relies heavily on irony and mockery, often conveying the opposite of what's literally said. Here, we're developing a solution to navigate this ambiguity and bring clarity to online communication.

**Why This Matters?**

 Our solution aims to achieve just that, by:

* **Boosting Sentiment Accuracy:**  By recognizing sarcasm, we can paint a more accurate picture of sentiment in tweets. 
* **Real-Time Customer Feedback:**  Imagine understanding customer sentiment in real-time, allowing for better and faster feedback management. 
* **Scalable Framework:**  This project is designed to be adaptable, catering to various industries that require sarcasm detection capabilities.
  
**Features:**

Here's a peek under to see what makes this project tick:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preparing textual data.
* **Feature Extraction:** Methods to extract meaningful features from text.
* **Model Training:** Implementation of various machine learning models for sarcasm detection.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Tools to evaluate the performance of the models.
* **Visualization: Visual** representation of data and results.

**The Data Description:**

The dataset used for this project consists of Tweets and is collected from Hugging Face.
Each review is labeled as either sarcastic (yes) or non-sarcastic (no).

**The Model:**

We'll try various machine learning models and deep learning models against each other in a battle for supremacy. Here are these:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* Na√Øve Bayes Model
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
* Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)
* Random Forest

**Finding the best Model:**

The evaluation metrics used includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model among all is the BLSTM model with 89.97% accurate predictions.
