Introduction:\
Sarcasm detection in tweets is the task of automatically identifying whether a tweet contains sarcasm or not.  Sarcasm, as you know, uses irony or mockery to convey the opposite of the literal meaning.\
Overall, sarcasm detection in tweets is an active area of research with significant challenges. As models and techniques continue to improve, they can play a valuable role in making sense of the often-ambiguous world of online communication.

Scope of the Solution:\
Accurately detects sarcasm, improving sentiment analysis in Tweets.\
Enables real-time sarcasm detection for timely customer feedback management.\
Scalable framework adaptable to various industries needing sarcasm detection.

Features:\
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing textual data.\
Feature Extraction: Methods to extract meaningful features from text.\
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models for sarcasm detection.\
Evaluation Metrics: Tools to evaluate the performance of the models.\
Visualization: Visual representation of data and results.

Dataset:\
The dataset used for this project consists of Tweets and is collected from Hugging Face.\
Each review is labeled as either sarcastic (yes) or non-sarcastic (no).

Model Training:\
The project supports several machine learning models, including:

Gradient Boosting Machine\
Na√Øve Bayes Model\
Logistic Regression\
Support Vector Machine\
Decision tree\
K - Nearest Neighbor\
CNN\
GRU\
Bidirectional LSTM\
BERT\
RNN 

Results:\
The evaluation metrics used includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model among all is the CNN model with 90.84% accurate predictions.
